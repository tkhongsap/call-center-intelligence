Fix Uploads PRD gaps: Verify feed item creation and alert recomputation after upload.

## Tasks (complete in sequence):

### 1. Investigate Current Upload Flow
- Read `app/api/uploads/route.ts` to understand POST handler
- Read `app/api/feed/route.ts` to understand feed item structure
- Read `lib/scripts/compute-alerts.ts` to understand alert computation
- Check `lib/db/schema.ts` for feedItems and uploads table structure
- Document findings before making changes

### 2. Add Feed Item Creation to Upload Handler
- In POST handler of `app/api/uploads/route.ts`:
  - After successful upload record creation, insert a feed item
  - Feed item type should be 'upload'
  - Include upload metadata (filename, status, record counts)
  - Set appropriate timestamp
- Verify feed items table has necessary columns for upload type
- File: app/api/uploads/route.ts

### 3. Verify Alert Recomputation Trigger
- Check if uploads route triggers compute-alerts
- If not, add async call to trigger alert recomputation:
  - Option A: Call compute-alerts script via child_process
  - Option B: Create API endpoint `/api/alerts/recompute` and call it
  - Option C: Import compute function directly if exported
- Alert recomputation should be non-blocking (fire and forget)
- Add error handling that logs but doesn't fail the upload
- Files: app/api/uploads/route.ts, potentially app/api/alerts/recompute/route.ts (new)

### 4. Test the Integration
- After changes, verify:
  - Upload creates a record in uploads table
  - Feed item appears in feed API response
  - Alert computation runs (check logs or alerts table)
- Add console.log statements temporarily if needed for verification

## Technical Requirements:
- Non-blocking async operations for feed item and alert computation
- Proper error handling (don't fail upload if secondary operations fail)
- TypeScript strict mode required
- Follow existing patterns in codebase

## Quality Checks Before Each Commit:
- npm run typecheck (must pass)
- npm run lint (must pass)

## Completion Criteria:
- Uploads create corresponding feed items
- Alert recomputation is triggered after upload
- No regression to existing upload functionality
- All quality checks pass

Output <promise>UPLOADS GAPS COMPLETE</promise> when ALL tasks are done and quality checks pass.
