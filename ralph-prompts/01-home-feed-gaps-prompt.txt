Fix Home Feed PRD gaps: Add Role Switcher and Inbox Badge to Header.

## Tasks (complete in sequence):

### 1. Create RoleSwitcher Component
- Create `components/layout/RoleSwitcher.tsx`
- Implement dropdown with three roles:
  - PM/PO (Admin) - Full access to all BUs
  - BU Manager - BU-scoped view
  - Call Center Supervisor - Operational view
- Store selected role in localStorage (key: 'selectedRole')
- Export a useRole hook or context for other components to read
- Style to match Twitter-inspired dark theme aesthetic
- Files: components/layout/RoleSwitcher.tsx (new)

### 2. Add RoleSwitcher to Header
- Import and add RoleSwitcher to Header.tsx
- Position in right side actions area, before SSE Toggle
- Hidden on mobile (sm:block), visible on tablet+
- File: components/layout/Header.tsx

### 3. Create Inbox Count API Endpoint
- Create `app/api/inbox/count/route.ts`
- Query shares table for recipient with status='pending'
- Return JSON: { count: number, hasEscalations: boolean }
- For now, use mock user ID 'user-admin-001' (same as inbox route)
- File: app/api/inbox/count/route.ts (new)

### 4. Add Inbox Badge to Header
- Add Inbox icon with badge counter in Header
- Fetch unread count from `/api/inbox/count`
- Show red badge with count (hide badge if count is 0)
- Use usePolling hook similar to alert count
- Badge should show orange if hasEscalations is true
- Link to /inbox page
- File: components/layout/Header.tsx

## Technical Requirements:
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Follow existing patterns in Header.tsx (usePolling, locale-aware links)
- Use lucide-react icons (User for role switcher, Inbox for inbox badge)
- TypeScript strict mode required
- Support both English and Thai locales (add translation keys if needed)

## Quality Checks Before Each Commit:
- npm run typecheck (must pass)
- npm run lint (must pass)

## Completion Criteria:
- RoleSwitcher dropdown visible and functional in Header
- Role persists across page refreshes (localStorage)
- Inbox badge shows unread count
- Badge hides when count is 0
- Both components are responsive

Output <promise>HOME FEED GAPS COMPLETE</promise> when ALL tasks are done and quality checks pass.
