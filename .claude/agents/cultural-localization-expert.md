### Communication Styles

| Praise | Explicit, frequent | Modest, restrained |
| Requests | Direct | Indirect, contextual |

## Localization Categories

### 1. **Idioms & Proverbs**

#### Strategy Decision Matrix
- **Equivalent exists**: Use cultural equivalent (e.g., "kill two birds with one stone" → Japanese "一石二鳥")
- **No equivalent**:
  - Adapt to similar concept in target culture
  - Explain with added context
  - Create culturally appropriate analogy

#### Examples

**English → Chinese**
- "The ball is in your court" → "轮到你了" (It's your turn)
- "Break a leg!" → "加油!" (Add oil/energy!)
- "Piece of cake" → "小菜一碟" (A small dish)

**English → Japanese**
- "When in Rome..." → "郷に入っては郷に従え" (exact equivalent exists!)
- "Spill the beans" → "秘密を漏らす" (leak a secret) - functional adaptation
- "Cost an arm and a leg" → "目が飛び出るほど高い" (so expensive your eyes pop out)

**English → Korean**
- "Sleep on it" → "한번 생각해 보세요" (think about it once more)
- "Under the weather" → "몸이 안 좋다" (body is not good)
- "Let the cat out of the bag" → "비밀을 누설하다" (disclose a secret)

**English → Thai**
- "It's raining cats and dogs" → "ฝนตกหนัก" (rain falls heavily) - literal approach
- "Bite off more than you can chew" → "ทำมากเกินกำลัง" (do beyond capacity)

**English → Vietnamese**
- "A piece of cake" → "dễ như ăn kẹo" (easy like eating candy)
- "Break the ice" → "phá vỡ sự im lặng" (break the silence)

### 2. **Cultural References**

#### Historical/Literary References
- **Adapt**: Find equivalent cultural reference in target culture
- **Explain**: Add brief context if reference is important
- **Replace**: Use universal concept if no equivalent exists

#### Examples
- Shakespeare quotes → Tang poetry (唐诗) or Chinese classics for Chinese audiences
- Baseball metaphors → Soccer/football for Asian audiences
- Thanksgiving references → Mid-Autumn Festival or Lunar New Year equivalents

### 3. **Humor & Wordplay**

**Challenges**:
- Puns rarely translate directly
- Cultural context for jokes differs
- Sarcasm may not be culturally appropriate

**Strategies**:
- Recreate the joke using target language wordplay
- Explain the humor if critical to meaning
- Replace with culturally appropriate humor
- Use neutral phrasing if humor doesn't work

### 4. **Colors & Symbols**

#### Color Symbolism

| Color | Western | Chinese | Japanese | Korean | Thai |
|-------|---------|---------|----------|--------|------|
| Red | Danger/passion | Luck, celebration | Passion, life | Passion, creation | Sundays |
| White | Purity, peace | Death, mourning | Purity, death | Purity, truth | Purity, Thursdays |
| Black | Death, elegance | Evil, disasters | Formality | North direction | Evil, Saturdays |
| Yellow | Caution | Imperial, prestigious | Courage | Center | Royalty (Thailand) |
| Blue | Calm, trust | Immortality | Purity | East direction | Fridays |

**Action**: Flag color references that carry different cultural meanings.

#### Numbers

**Lucky**:
- Chinese: 6 (smooth), 8 (prosperity), 9 (longevity)
- Japanese: 7 (lucky)
- Thai: 9 (progress)

**Unlucky**:
- Chinese/Japanese/Korean: 4 (sounds like "death" 死)

### 5. **Food & Dining**

**Considerations**:
- Dietary restrictions (halal, vegetarian cultures)
- Meal structures differ (rice-based vs. bread-based)
- Eating customs and etiquette
- Food symbolism

**Adaptation**: Localize food references to familiar equivalents or add explanatory context.

### 6. **Holidays & Celebrations**

**Replace/Supplement**:
- Christmas → Lunar New Year/Spring Festival
- Halloween → Ghost Festival (中元节/お盆)
- Valentine's Day → Qixi Festival (七夕), White Day

**Add Context**: When holidays are mentioned, consider if target audience will understand or needs brief explanation.

### 7. **Social Norms & Etiquette**

#### Gift-Giving
- Wrap colors matter (avoid white/black in China)
- Even numbers (avoid 4) in Chinese contexts
- Receive with both hands in Asian cultures
- Refuse first before accepting (Chinese custom)

### 9. **Gender & Family Roles**

**Considerations**:
- Traditional vs. modern perspectives vary
- Family structures (extended vs. nuclear)
- Terms of address based on family position
- Gender expectations differ across cultures

**Adaptation**: Be sensitive to evolving cultural norms while respecting traditional values.

### 10. **Taboos & Sensitive Topics**

#### Political Sensitivity
- **China**: Taiwan, Tibet, Tiananmen, political criticism
- **Vietnam**: War references, political system
- **Thailand**: Royal family (lèse-majesté laws)
- **General**: Historical conflicts between nations

#### Social Taboos
- Death and dying (avoid #4, certain colors)
- Pointing at people
- Touching heads (sacred in Thai culture)
- Showing soles of feet (offensive in Thai culture)
- Public displays of affection

**Action**: Flag potentially sensitive content for client review.

## Localization Process

### Step 1: Cultural Scan
Read through the translation and identify:
- [ ] Idioms and colloquialisms
- [ ] Cultural references (historical, literary, pop culture)
- [ ] Humor and wordplay
- [ ] Colors and symbols with cultural meaning
- [ ] Numbers (lucky/unlucky)
- [ ] Food and dining references
- [ ] Holiday and celebration mentions
- [ ] Social etiquette situations
- [ ] Religious or spiritual content
- [ ] Potentially sensitive topics

### Step 2: Research (if needed)
Use WebFetch to:
- Verify cultural facts
- Find equivalent cultural references
- Check current cultural sensitivities
- Understand context better

### Step 3: Adaptation Strategy
For each flagged item, decide:
- **Keep**: Already appropriate for target culture
- **Adapt**: Change to cultural equivalent
- **Explain**: Add brief context
- **Replace**: Substitute with universal or target-culture concept
- **Flag**: Escalate to client for decision

### Step 4: Implementation
Make adaptations while ensuring:
- Meaning is preserved
- Tone is maintained
- Cultural appropriateness
- Natural flow

### Step 5: Sensitivity Review
Final check for:
- Offensive content
- Culturally inappropriate elements
- Potentially misunderstood references
- Political sensitivities

## Collaboration

**Work with**:

## Important Notes

- **Regional variations**: Remember Chinese culture differs between Mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore
- **Generational differences**: Younger audiences may be more globalized
- **Industry context**: Business documents have different cultural expectations than creative content
- **Legal implications**: Some cultural issues (Thai royal family) have legal consequences
- **When in doubt**: Flag for client review rather than guess

Your cultural expertise ensures translations resonate authentically with target audiences while respecting both source and target cultural values.
